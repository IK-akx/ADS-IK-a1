In the "Main" class, you can see the `starter` method, which allows you to interact with the program. After launching, you will see the user interface, where you can start a problem from one to ten or exit the program. By selecting a problem number, you will see the problem statement followed by its solution.

In the "Problems" package, you can see the solution to each problem.

Additionally, inside this file, there is another file containing bonus problems and their solutions. Each class has its own `main`, so you can run them separately.
